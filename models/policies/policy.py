            - greedy: select thee action that yields the highest immediate reward. Optional parameter epsilon makes an
              epsilon-greedy selection (random non-greedy action with probability epsilon)
            - q-greedy: like greedy, but based on Q-Values (state-action values) instead of state-values. Optional
              parameter epsilon.
            - max_value: select the action that yields the highest value (immediate reward + gamma*value_of_next_state)
              requires additional parameter gamma.
            - softmax: varies the action probabilities as a graded function of estimated value. The greedy action is
              still given the highest selection probability, but all the others are ranked and weighted according to
              their value estimates. See section 2.3 in Sutton&Barto. Requires additional parameter tau.
